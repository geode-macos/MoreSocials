# MoreSocials
jarvisdevil, back again. just built another mod again.  
what do i have to offer this time? hmmmmmmmm... OH YEAAAAAAAAAAAAH I REMEMBER NOW!! :DDDDDD  
  
This is a mod that lets users add more socials to the right side of their profile such as Discord, Bluesky, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, GitHub and possibly much more in the future. Pretty cool right? (*whispers to self* gosh I am so smart)  
  
Some of these should've been added in vanilla since RobTop has the sprites done already. Anyways that's about it, nothing too special. BYEEEE!!! :DDDDD
